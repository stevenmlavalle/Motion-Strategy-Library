MOTION STRATEGY LIBRARY

The examples in these directories are provided to illustrate
how to use MSL.  Reasonable parameters have been selected for
each example so that plangl can be executed directly on them;
however, the parameter values are not necessarily the best
choices.  In some cases, a planning algorithm might fail to
solve the problem.  This occurs partly because we continue 
to change the software without repeatedly testing this large
collection of examples.  Hopefully, we will improve the examples
in future versions.  Please be patient...
