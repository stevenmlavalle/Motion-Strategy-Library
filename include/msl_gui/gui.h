//! A generic class for designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
/*!
The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed as a hierarchy of
classes to enable specific user interfaces to be designed for a
variety of different motion strategy problems and planning algorithms.
Currently, there is one derived class which serves as the GUI for all
of the RRT-based planners.  Each instance of Gui includes an instance
of an RRT Planner class and an instance of a Render class.  Using this
design, the same basic GUI design can be used, regardless of the
particular rendering methods.
